predict videos using GAN, see project_rs in the repository "paper samples"

model - the network structure of Generator and Discriminator to generate video from a single image 
opticalflowvideo - to generate optical flow of a image sequence 
data_loader1.py - to load image sequence together with the optical flow
train - using WGAN-GP loss to train the GAN
